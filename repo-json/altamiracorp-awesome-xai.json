    "description": "This paper provides an introduction to the social science research into explanations. The author provides 4 major findings: (1) explanations are constrastive, (2) explanations are selected, (3) probabilities probably don't matter, (4) explanations are social. These fit into the general theme that explanations are -contextual-."

    "description": "An important read for anyone using saliency maps. This paper proposes two experiments to determine whether saliency maps are useful: (1) model parameter randomization test compares maps from trained and untrained models, (2) data randomization test compares maps from models trained on the original dataset and models trained on the same dataset with randomized labels. They find that \"some widely deployed saliency methods are independent of both the data the model was trained on, and the model parameters\"."
