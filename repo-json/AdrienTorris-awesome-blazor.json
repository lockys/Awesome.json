Sometimes you need full access to the native capabilities of the device. You can now host Blazor components in .NET MAUI apps to build cross-platform native apps using web UI. The components run natively in the .NET process and render web UI to an embedded web view control using a local interop channel. This hybrid approach gives you the best of native and the web. Your components can access native functionality through the .NET platform, and they render standard web UI. .NET MAUI Blazor apps can run anywhere .NET MAUI can (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android) although our primary focus for .NET 6 is on desktop scenarios."

The relatively simple ones are using template strings with placeholders to be replaced by some concrete values. The other template engines can do everything the simple ones can but additionally provide means for control of the code flow, like if-else statements, loops, and further. In this article, I will focus on the latter by using the Razor engine inside a Blazor WebAssembly application."
